# Energy_Forecasting
Forecast energy utilization 


Energy repository is a project to predict peak energy utilization for a building. This invovled merging weather data with energy utilization metrics into one file for the LSTM model to learn and be able to generalize on new data. This multivariate examples demonstrates LSTM model, one-to-one forecast, LSTM model many-to-one forecast, specifically forecast energy consumption for the next 3 and 6 time intervals.
